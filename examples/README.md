# oauth2.zig Examples

These are some examples on how to use different providers. To run an example, add your `client_id` and `client_secret` to the example code where you see `<your_client_id>` and `<your_client_secret>`, then run the example with:
```sh
zig build run-<example_name> # For example, `zig build run-google`
```
